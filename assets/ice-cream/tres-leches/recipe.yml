    text: Did not miss the whole milk. Minimal ice particles. Mix-in of chocolate chip cookies went well. Next time, decrease condensed milk and increase milk.

    text: This pint melted fast - 5 mins on the counter may be too long. It may be worth putting in freezer to rechill after processing. Little to no ice in texture. Taste was light - however left a thick fat taste in mouth after eating. I want to try this recipe again with 2% milk.
